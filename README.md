*A Gamified Journey Through School*

## 🌟 Project Vision
LifeQuest is an interactive web app that guides students through the stages of school (elementary, middle, and high school) using mini-games, journaling prompts, and reflection challenges. The purpose is to help students see school as a meaningful journey and reflect on their growth.

## 🎯 SMART Goals
1. **Specific** – Create a web app with 3 stages (elementary, middle, high school). Each stage will contain 1 mini-game and 1 journaling/reflection prompt.  
2. **Measurable** – By December, the app will include at least 3 mini-games, 3 journaling prompts, and a badge/progress system.  
3. **Achievable** – Use React (front-end), GitHub (version control), and Netlify (hosting). Focus on simple mini-games.  
4. **Relevant** – Supports student growth by combining learning, reflection, and gamification.  
5. **Time-bound** – Prototype finished by **December 5, 2025** (Capstone Showcase).
